Students will get to see my work in progress and preparations for exhibitions. Our classes are offered by the semester, 4 week series, workshops and drop in. My teaching philosophy is to encourage</p><p>          creative thinking and problem solving while teaching students to develop a rich visual aesthetic. I design projects for kids and adults with an observational and process based approach to art making. Classes will be divided by age and material</p><p>          and students will be offered age appropriate materials and tools. I have a variety of materials available to my students like clay, acrylic and watercolor painting, fabric, woodworking tools and supplies, plaster, collage, and mixed media sculpture</p><p>          supplies. All of my students will have access to the studio tools, supplies and materials so they may gravitate to the medium that works best for their personal projects and goals. Students will be encouraged to draw from observation to learn</p><p>          how to see and develop a strong visual vocabulary and at the same time take a process based approach with materials to expand the possibilities of their art making.</p>"}}},{"__typename":"PrismicPostBodyImage","slice_type":"image","id":"Prismic__PostBodyImage__Prismic__Post__XrObsREAACIArez5__body__3","primary":{"image":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5544041450777202,"src":"/static/63278280cfb20df5b01e4e6f2ebc8836/a6c62/65f08186-70a2-495c-9acf-390db91f29a6_fuji.jpg","srcSet":"/static/63278280cfb20df5b01e4e6f2ebc8836/b3cab/65f08186-70a2-495c-9acf-390db91f29a6_fuji.jpg 300w,\n/static/63278280cfb20df5b01e4e6f2ebc8836/39f27/65f08186-70a2-495c-9acf-390db91f29a6_fuji.jpg 600w,\n/static/63278280cfb20df5b01e4e6f2ebc8836/a6c62/65f08186-70a2-495c-9acf-390db91f29a6_fuji.jpg 1200w","srcWebp":"/static/63278280cfb20df5b01e4e6f2ebc8836/a7c53/65f08186-70a2-495c-9acf-390db91f29a6_fuji.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/63278280cfb20df5b01e4e6f2ebc8836/5ba9d/65f08186-70a2-495c-9acf-390db91f29a6_fuji.webp 300w,\n/static/63278280cfb20df5b01e4e6f2ebc8836/6ef99/65f08186-70a2-495c-9acf-390db91f29a6_fuji.webp 600w,\n/static/63278280cfb20df5b01e4e6f2ebc8836/a7c53/65f08186-70a2-495c-9acf-390db91f29a6_fuji.webp 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"}}}}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"uid":"summer-2020"}},"staticQueryHashes":["23265376","3257754404"]}
